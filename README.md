## React-Dictionary

Dictionary WebApp created using React library along with Next.js framework. 

The main page allows users to enter a word they want to search and after half a second an API request is sent to grab the definition or synonyms/antonyms. The user can choose using a toggle if they want to see a definition or the synonyms/antonyms. The user will also see a 'Recent Searches' component that will update in real time. This shows a list of the 5 most recent searches. The component uses Local Storage to track each users recent searches. 

There is a planned 'Word of the Day' page, but is still under development.

Lastly, there is an 'About' page that just provides a little context to the project. 


Developer's Thoughts: 
This project introduced me to the React library and the Next.js library. I decided to use Typescript as well to introduce me to the syntax and declaring types. React is a great library that really simplified the process of building a Single Page WebApp. I really appreciated how Next.js implemented 'pages' as it was simple and easy to understand. Typescript proved to be a struggle to implement and I used it conservatively. Overall, I enjoyed working through the challenges the project presented and am happy to have experience using these tools.
